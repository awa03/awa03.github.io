<p>
    Classes can be linked together in order to pass data through one another. This idea is known
    as<font color="#fafad2"> <b>Inheritance</b></font>
    This base class / derived class relationship is often referred to as an "is a" relationship
    because the derived object really is an instance of the base object -- it's usually just a bit more specific (like a subcategory).
    The take out common features within the base class if they are used within the inherited classes
    It is essentially just a subcatagory of the base class.
    Note that this is different from the "has-a" relationship, in which objects are embedded inside of others
    (i.e. one object is a component of another).

</font></h1> <h1><font size="5" color="#8b0000">Protection Levels:</font></h1>
<p>Public signifies in this case that it is publicly derived from the base class name
In order to move data between these classes through inheritance we use protections, and
    public member data. Protection levels include public and private;</p>
<h1><font size="3" color="#f0f8ff"><b><font color="#fafad2">public - </font></b>Any member that is public can be accessed by name from anywhere.</font> <br>
    <font size="3" color="#f0f8ff"><b><font color="#fafad2">public - </font></b>Any member that is private can be accessed directly only by the class in which it is declared.</font></h1>
<p>The keyword protected: allows for inherited classes to have access to those member functions/data.
apart from this, it operates the same as the private member data.
    <br><b><font color="#fafad2">protected - </font></b> Any member that is protected can be accessed directly by the class in which it is
    declared, and by any classes that are derived from that class (but not from anywhere else).
</p>

</h1>
<p>The derived object is in an "is-an" relationship, an example being a car "is a" vehicle.
A "has-a" relationship references the data within the class. A car has a motor, A dog has a tail.</p>
<h1><font size="5" color="#8b0000">Constructors in derived classes:</font></h1>
<p>In this case, the derived object "is-an" instance of the base class as well.  So, when a derived object is created,
    the constructors from the base and derived classes will run. The order in which they run is important, too -- the
    base class constructor runs first, then the derived.
    <i><font size="3" color="white">"In other words the car class would run before the honda class"</font></center></i>
</p>
<h1>
    <font size="3"><b><i>Buddha</i> May Run In This Way</b><br>
    class Animals -> class Dogs -> class Boykin Spaniels -> Within The Dog Array</font>
</h1>
<p> Constructors may also have parameters within the inherited classes. For a derived class more
    data may need to be sent through. For example the car <br>Honda h(2, 3, 4, "green", "Accord");<br> <br>
    The numbers {2,3 for example} in the above example may be used to pass to the base functions. We can distribute
    the parameters to the appropriate functions we use an initalization list. The syntax can be seen below
</p>
<h1><font size="2">function prototype : initialization list

    <font color="#8b0000" size="5">This could be written as:</font><br>

        Car::Car(int c, int nd, char * cc) : Vehicle (c, id)<br>
        // this function moves the first 2 params to vehicle, using only nd & cc<br>

    <font color="#8b0000" size="5">Function Overriding:</font></h1><p>
    Since these classes are derived from one another they inherit from the base class. Take for example a students grad
    a class representing the students as a wholes data would be inherited by all the students, however the subclass computer
    science majors may only be inherited by a few students. However, if the called function should look different in each of the
    subclasses (an example being a grade calculation function; different grading styles may occur per major) we need
    to override the function.We just need to redeclare the "GradeReport" within the sub class functions. Remember that the
    derived classes inherit <font color="#fafad2"><b>everything</b></font> from its parent classes. To call the parent functions
    we need :: to refrence. Ex. Student::GradeReport(); <br></p>

</a> </h1>
<center><font size="10" color="#8b0000">Virtual Functions</font></center>
<p> We cannot use a basic loop (as given in the class example) to store the list of students. This is because of possible seperation within the array-
    some students may be undergraduates, some may be graduates, etc. To account for this we can use a few solutions. We may create
    arrays within each subtype, however this is not scalable so may be hard to use in larger applications. We can get around this issue by
    using a base class pointer. Normally a pointer may only point at one type however, a pointer to a base class can be pointed at an object derived from
    the base class. Similarly, a base class type reference variable can refer to an object derived from that base class.
</p>

    <font size="2">
        Student s; Grad g; Undergrad u;<br>
        Student *sp1, *sp2, *sp3;<br>
        sp1 = &s;    // sp1 is now pointing at Student object <br>
        sp2 = &g;    // sp2 is now pointing at Grad object <br>
        sp3 = &u;    // sp3 is now pointing at Undergrad object <br>
    </font>
    <font size="5" color="#8b0000">Herogeneous List</font>
</h1>
<p>
    A <font color="#fafad2"><b>heterogeneous list</b></font> is made by creating a single array of pointers to the base class. The pointers can be pointed to any objects which are derived from the base class.
    So it is essentially a list of pointers to class object, an array of objects. This allows us to store diffrent data types within the array because they are all objects. Everything is a pointer
    to the base class
</p>
<h1>
    <font size="2">
        Student * list[300000]; // an array of Student Pointers <br>
        list[0] = &g;           // using the earlier grad object <br>
        list[1] = &u;           // undergrad object <br>
        list[2] = new Grad;     // dynamic grad object <br>
        // can add any subtype of student <br>
    </font>
    <font size="5" color="#8b0000">Virtual Functions</font>
</h1>
<p>
    Heterogeneous Functions may solve the first issue, however who's version of Grade Report will run? if
    we attempted to run functions within the student list (like list[i]-> GradeReport();) we run into the issue of binding
    because list[i] is declared as a student pointer. The function call is bound to the definition. This means that the definition
    is static and the compiler cannot know what we would be pointing towards, because of this we need a way to bind to the correct definition
    at run time (dynamic).
    <br>
    The <font color="#fafad2">virtual</font> keyword allows us to link the definition dynamically. This will override the base class function only when it
    is called through a pointer, so it will run the target version. The syntax (in the student example) can be seen below
</p>
<h1>
    <font size="2">
        class Student<br>
        { public:<br>
        virtual void GradeReport();<br>
        };
    </font>
</h1>
<p>
    Now the grade report function can be called through a pointer base class. Virtual functions are not
    specific to heterogeneous lists, they just work well in conjunction.
</p>
<h1>
    <font size="2">
        Student *sp1, *sp2, *sp3; <br>
        Student s;    Grad g;     Undergrad u; <br>
        sp1 = &s; <br>
        sp2 = &g; <br>
        sp3 = &u; <br>

        sp1->GradeReport();    // runs Student's version <br>
        sp2->GradeReport();    // runs Grad's version <br>
        sp3->GradeReport();    // runs Undergrad's version <br>
    </font>
    <font size="5" color="#8b0000">Abstract Classes</font>
</h1>
<p>
    In some situations the base class may be so obscure that we may not want to build
    objects out of it. An Example being things on earth. If we are referencing dogs, things
    on earth may be too loose of a basis to transfer any direct meaningful inheritance to the dog
    object. Or the course example: For instance, class Student might not have enough information for
    the full grade reports -- we need to know what kind of student (i.e. which subtype). If you do not want
    to actually do anything in the Student's version of GradeReport, you are allowed to leave out its function
    definition altogether.<br><br>
    virtual void GradeReport()=0;<br><br>
    The function shown above is giving its own definition (known as a <font color="#fafad2">pure virtual function</font>),
    this does not have to be the case, the function may be left without an "=?", but it is often dont when the base class
    version has essentially no work to do.
    <br> <br>
    Any class with one pure virtual function is known as an <font color="#fafad2">abstract class.</font> An abstract class
    cannot be instantiated (cannot build an object of this class type). They are used as base classes for inheritance heiarchies
    , and they are intended only as a place to put data and functions common to classes derived from them, as well as a place for
    virtual functions. Abstract classes can still be used to build pointers, though, which is useful when taking advantage of virtual
    functions.

</h1>
<p>
    This example presents a hierarchy of derived classes that is based on a class called Employee.  The goal is a program that stores
    Employee information and handles the printing of their paychecks.  Note the use of the virtual PrintCheck function, and the building of the heterogeneous list in the sample main program.
