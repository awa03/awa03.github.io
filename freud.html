    A Brief Introduction To Freud

    Introduction

    This essay centers around the ideas of Freud and how these ideas shape our desire, personality, etc. This is a
    generalized summary that contains everything you will need to have a basic understanding of Freud. I ask that if you
    struggle with any of the verbiages or may see something as repulsive (the classic sex with your mom for example) you
    first refer to the glossary at the end of the essay. I ask that you read this with an open mind because truthfully Freud
    is not as controversial as you may think, and much of the controversy centered around him is due to misinterpretations of
    his writings.
  </p>
  <h3>
    The Id
  </h3>
  <p>
    Let's begin with the Id. The id is driven by the pleasure principle and is the only developed system that is present
    at birth. The pleasure principle simply being the process of seeking immediate gratification. Take for instance food, the
    id, if you were hungry, would tell you to go grab food or get it to fulfill that desire. The id acts however solely on this
    desire for immediate gratification so it would urge you to say eat your roommate's food. Thus the Id is not subject to morality
    on its own. This explains why young children are pure proponents of desire not taking into account the needs of their mother
    (their object of desire, which will be later explained.) Freud summarizes this in the quote below (Intro To Psycho-Analysis, 14)
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “It contains everything that is inherited, that is present at birth, that is laid down in the constitution-above all, therefore the
      instincts, which originate from the somatic organization and which find a first physical expression [in the ID] in forms unknown to us.”
    </i> <br><br>
    So the Id can be briefly summarized as our human instincts, for desire. The Id is part of something Freud calls the
    Ucs, also known as the unconscious. The unconscious is one of 3; Ucs, Pcs (preconscious), and Cs (conscious). The
    unconscious is derived from the repression theory and is as Freud states a “Prototype of the unconscious” (The Ego & The Id, 5)
    <br><br>
    The Id bridges the separation between the body and the mind. It brings with it the instinctual desire for pleasure
    and finds a pattern within this. Seeking the activity that they desire most. It wishes to keep the nervous system stable,
    which masters the stimuli. The source of this is within the bodily organs.
    <br><br>
    The Id does not observe time (later further explained). This can be understood through the analogy of gambling or even
    playing video games. If we were to act on our desire and gamble time passes at a much more rapid rate because the id is not
    observing the time constraints you may have. This may also be a proponent of procrastination.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">How do we Live with the Id (harmoniously)</text><br>
    To live with the Id we must first recognize its existence. The id as previously explained is amoral so we must strike boundaries
    with it, or negotiate (later explained). An example of negotiation would be having a cheat day once a week so that the id has a level
    of satisfaction but the principle of reality and —moderation is still met, without complete pleasure.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Resolution</text><br>
    However what if these desires cannot be met? Take for example libidinal desire, let's assume there is no way the individual can
    satisfy the needs of their libido. There is tension created because the desire cannot be met. These desires can be satisfied in other
    ways such as; dreams (mentioned later) or the visualization of that desire. The latter is known as the primary process. Primary Process examples
    are daydreaming, hallucinations, etc. So in the example given you may imagine having sex to curve your desire.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Oral Phase</text><br>
    The Id, as aforementioned, is the only developed system present at birth. This coincides with the oral phase. This is important
    because the Id makes sure all of the child's basic needs are met at birth, and shapes the later formation of the child. The oral phase is the
    child's phase of pure desire being met solely through their mouths. Examples are; a child is sad-> They cure this with their pacifier. So as
    Freud understands it is an issue within this stage (being deprived of the breast, etc) would lead to Oral Fixation within the individual. Take
    for example an eating disorder or a smoker, Freud would assume this issue was derived from a problem within the Oral stage.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Should we attempt to overcome the Id?</text><br>
    The simple answer is no. No matter how much we try the id is an essential function of the human psyche. Yoga as Freud describes is
    an attempt to overcome the id. Yoga is the attempt of overcoming instincts, through the complete control of instinctual life. This control of the
    instincts kills satisfaction itself to some degree. This is because the desires of the untamed ego are much more intense than the preserved ones of
    the tamed ego. Hence why genital sex is so desirable. It is an expression of the untamed ego's desire.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Practical Understanding Of Overcoming the Pleasure Principle (The Id)</text><br>
    Let's say you start a diet. This diet may be harder to follow if the diet is an immediate change. This is why ‘fad’ or ‘crash’ diets tend not
    to succeed. This is because the Id hates discomfort, and depriving the Id suddenly of satisfaction will cause it discomfort. This may also be
    applied to many other situations such as drug addiction. This is why quitting cold turkey may be impossible for some, the discomfort of the Id
    is too much to handle.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">You will never be happy.</text><br>
    However, there is also the issue of the Pleasure Principle. The pleasure principle as forementioned is the “process of seeking immediate gratification.”
    However, this can never be fully fulfilled. Yet giving up on achieving the satisfaction of the pleasure principle is greater unpleasure than never succeeding
    in meeting the needs of the pleasure principle. We must come to some degree to the needs of the pleasure principle, and accept its existence. We must not avoid
    it, but recognize its importance of it, and impose the reality principle upon it (mentioned in The Ego).
  </p>
  <h3>
    The Ego
  </h3>
  <p>
    The ego is derived from the Id (created in the first 3 years of the child's life), through the changes in external stimuli.
    It envelops some of the Id but not all, it is then not sharply differentiated due to the lower half merging into the Id. The ego
    is only cut off from the Id by instances of repression. Therefore the ego acts as a mediary between the external and the internal world and
    allows communication between the ego and the Id. Even though the ego is a mediary it avoids some stimulus dulling down the external world. It portrays
    a shrunken-down version of what the ego is experiencing in the world around it. As seen in the quotes below (The Ego and The Id, 19)(Civilization and Its Discontents, 15)
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “[…]The ego seeks to bring the influence of the external world to bear upon the Id and its tendencies, and endeavors to
      substitute the reality principle for the pleasure principle that reigns unrestrictedly in the Id.”
      <br>
      "Our present ego-feeling is, therefore, only a shrunken down residue of a much more inclusive — indeed, an all-embracing
      — feeling which corresponded to a more intimate bond between the ego and the world about it."
    </i>
    The ego much like the Id seeks pleasure but it is more restrained in its manner. It does this by postponing internal satisfaction to meet the needs of the external world.
    It then seeks to maintain this pleasure through self-preservation. This imposition is known as the reality principle. As Freud puts it-
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “It has the task of self preservation. As regards to external events , it preforms the task by becoming aware of the stimuli, by storing up exsperiences about them,
      by avoiding excessivly strong stimuli, by dealing with moderate stimuli, and finally by learing to bring about expedient changes in the external world to its own advantage.
    </i>
    The ego represents what we know as common sense or reason, which is in contrast to the Id which represents passion.
    The ego strives to avoid anxiety; being object anxiety (external threat; starvation, punishment, etc) and neurotic anxiety
    (ego is overwhelmed by the id's desire, mainly sexual). This is due to not all desires being pleasurable. The ego seeks
    to min/max the desires of the id and superego. Take for example eating junk food on a diet. Your Id may feel satisfied because
    it tastes more appealing than the alternative however you may feel the pain as well of cheating on your diet. So the ego seeks to
    rationalize and negotiate between the two. The ego also works to transform the will of the Id as if it were it's own. This is due to as
    forementioned the ego being a product of the Id. Therefore the ego works within Cs, Pcs, and Ucs. The differentiating factor within the ego is language.
    <br><br>
    Freud describes the ego using the analogy of a man on horseback. This can be seen in the quote below (The Ego and the Id, 19).
    <i>
      One might compare the relation of the ego to the id with that between a rider and his horse. The horse provides the locomotor energy, and the rider has the prerogative of
      determining the goal and of guiding the movements of his powerful mount towards it. But all too often in the relations between the ego and the id we
      find a picture of the less ideal situation in which the rider is obliged to guide his horse in the direction in which it itself wants to go.
    </i>
    <br><br>
    The ego may appear to us as autonomous, acting as an entity. However, the ego continues inward past the points we may
    recognize (aforementioned). The ego defines its lines sharply, in relation to the object and the ego. The only threat to this
    separation between the object and ego however is love. This is a bonding of the object and the ego as one being. As Freud refers to it,
    “[…]’I’ and ‘you’ are one.” (Civilization and Its Discontents, 13). Within love the individual emotions may feel as though they are alien, this is due
    to the individual ascribing their emotions from the ego to the external world. From this we can determine the ego is not a constant but rather is dependent
    on other factors. This also warrants our theory that the ego evolves and is not constant from birth.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Development of the Ego</text><br>
    At birth the child recognized the mother's breast as an extension of itself, therefore it cannot differentiate from the external world. Through development, the child learns
    to differentiate the external world and grows to then recognize its bodily organs.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Ucs, Pcs, and Cs
  </h3>
  <p>
    <text class="h4">Pcs</text><br>
    Preconciousness is not physically differentiated from the unconscious, because of this they are both physical. Something becomes preconscious through the connection with
    word presentations connected to it. The preconscious was at one point a perception, such as what you ate for dinner last night. These ideas can be drawn upon and recollected,
    or a better example maybe your birthday. The Pcs is also capable, for instance, you may awake from a daydream and solve a math equation within the dream. Thoughts within the Pcs are
    not repressed like the unconscious thoughts rather they are just latent. This however does not mean the Ucs coincide with the repressed rather, “it is still true that all that is repressed
    is Ucs but not all that is Ucs is repressed.” To add to this the Pcs are also a great deal closer to the Cs than the Ucs, even though it is only separated definitionally and not literally. To
    become Pcs something must establish a word presentation with it. Without word presentation, we have as Freud said, ‘a incomplete consciousness’. These word presentations may be distorted in
    different manners and intensities. The visual component to this process is then secondary. Take reading for example, without a mnemic to assign to the text there is no meaning in the words. The
    visualization is a product of the verbiage associated with it. This will later lead us to the importance of dreams.
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “two kinds of unconscious — one which is easily, under frequently occurring circumstances, transformed into something conscious, and another
      with which this transformation is difficult and takes place only subject to a considerable expenditure of effort or possibly never at all. […] We call the unconscious which is only latent, and
      thus easily becomes conscious, the ‘preconscious’, and retain the term ‘unconscious’ for the other”
      <br>
      “Cs is the surface level of the mental apparatus”
    </i>
    (The Anatomy of the Mental Personality)(The Ego and The Id, 11)
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Ucs</text><br>
    The unconscious is a product of the ego and Id and is a matter of perception. Simply put it is not being actively thought about. The Ucs motivate every action that we take (Take Freudian Slips).
    The Ucs does not observe time, and accidents do not occur from it. Every action according to Freud is purposeful. Take for example you accidentally hit your knee on a table, this may be a purposeful
    relief of pain and frustration within your life. The Ucs can also create disorganization of memory. Take for example a debate. Within this debate, if looking back on in say a month's time, the two debatings stories
    will not fully corroborate. One person may remember you saying something when the other may not. This can be due to intense emotions in the time period, examples being pain repressing some aspect of the memory. These
    extreme emotions can also lead to regression, which is a relapse in the psycho-sexual stages. In addition to this, the Ucs belong to the ego, however, the latent part (pcs) does not.
    <br><br>
    The mind acts similarly to the body of a human or animal. The comparison Freud provides is that of a developing child. The child may have the thymus glad replaced after puberty by the connective tissue. This however is
    still in a way preserved, as with the mind. Within the mind, instances may pass but can be reaccessed through regression. So the mind in a way grows and transforms from within itself, Freud provides the example of the marrow
    bone in this case. So some may be destroyed in the case of the connective tissue but also some may be transformed, to some extent.
    <br><br>
    The Ucs may also present guilt. This is due to the Ucs need for punishment and self-sabotage. I'm sure many of you can relate to this feeling of unconsciously ruining a relationship. This sense of guilt will later be used as
    the basis for the development of civilization (which I cover towards the end of this essay). The individual however does not recognize this as a feeling of guilt but rather one of illness. This will also be later addressed within our
    discussion of the superego and neurosis.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Slips Of the Tounge (Freudian Slips) produced by the Ucs</text><br>
    The unconscious may also leak out into the consciousness and be expressed through slips of the tongue. This is known as a Freudian Slip. The slips are a product of the repressed desires within the unconscious coming to the surface in a
    subliminal way. Take the example Micheal Sugrue gives of the calling Freud “Fraud” accidentally. On the surface, this may seem like a slip of the tongue but to Freud this is an expression of the individual’s true thoughts, being that Freud is a fraud.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">How Does Ucs become Pcs</text><br>
    Word Presentations must be assigned to the Ucs. As forementioned the Pcs has word presentations that come with it. Therefore we can assume that the Ucs is dealing with the unknown rather than an assigned presentation.
    Consciousness is what is at the surface of the base of thought. The process acts as follows; Ucs impulse->Repression->Unpleasant. Repression is the act of repressing something from achieving consciousness.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Cs</text><br>
    Consciousness is differentiated however from the Ucs by perception. Only something that was once Cs perception can become Cs. It does this by rising from within and transforming itself into external perceptions, made possible by memory traces. Cs is connected
    to the ego, with this the ego discharges excitement to the external world.
    <br><br>
    Everything becomes Cs is qualitative, quantitative, pleasure, and unpleasure. However, when we are referring to feelings there is no distinction between Cs and Pcs. The feelings are either Cs or Ucs (without/with word association).
    <br><br>
    The ego works to bring the external world within.
    <br><br>
    The ego is then in contrast to the id because it operates with restriction in accordance with reason. This curving of the desire can also be expressed in other avenues which Freud calls sublimation. Lets again look at sexual desire, the libido may wish to have its
    desire met but that may not be appropriate; in an inappropriate
    setting, or through guilt, etc. (This can also occur through the superego and can be reversed through dreams, aka true desire is shown without limitation within the dream.) This can be seen through someone such as Picasso, Freud would say that this artistic expression may
    be the libidos expression through sublimation. The process of
    dissolving these tensions within is known as the secondary process, however. Sublimation further relates to sexual desire through the final product. This may be equated to the orgasm as Freud expresses in the quote below.
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “In this, sublimation of the instincts lends its assistance. One gains the most if one can sufficiently heighten the yield of pleasure from the sources of physical and intellectual work. When that is so, fate can do little against one. Satisfaction of this kind, such as
      an artist's joy in giving his phantasies body, or scientists in solving problems or discovering truths has a special quality that we shall certainly one day be able to characterize in meta psychological terms.”
    </i>
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Eros and Thanatos</text><br>
    These instincts are as follows; Eros (sexual desires/love) and Thanatos (The desire to return to the state before life). Eros is described by Freud as following (The Ego and The Id, 37)
    <br><br>
    <i>
      It comprises not merely the uninhibited sexual instinct proper and the instinctual impulses of an aim-inhibited or sublimated nature derived from it, but also the self preservative instinct, which must be assigned to the ego[…]
    </i>
    <br><br>
    Eros works by complicating life. Love is the most intense experience of sensation, and with it lays out a path for our search for happiness. Love is the pursuit of objects, in obtaining them we form an emotional bond. This however can become a negative. Since love is the greatest
    and most intense experience we can possibly experience the loss of it is the greatest unhappiness. There may be many different products of men in this search for love. Freud described these in the following quote (Civilization and Its Discontents, 35).
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “The man who is predominantly erotic will give first preference to his emotional relationships to other people; the narcissistic man, who inclines to be self-sufficient, will seek his main satisfactions in his internal mental processes; the man of action will never give up the external
      world on which he can try out his strength”
    </i>
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Anal Stage</text><br>
    The anal stage occurs (much like the ego) from ages 1–to 3. This is the process of making the child feel confident and competent. It occurs with positive reinforcement in potty training.
  </p>
  <h3>
    The Super Ego
  </h3>
  <p>
    The superego is the third power within the structure. The ego seeks to satisfy the superego and the ego through meeting both of their demands. The superego may be known as a sort of drive for perfection, and moral actions. The superego much like the id also represents past influences (explained in the following paragraph).
    <br><br>
    The superego is derived from the child's relation to their parents. Therefore making the parents the ‘original super-ego’ to the child. Making the superego the influence of what is taken from other people. This is contrasted to the id (hereditary) and the ego (the individual's own experiences.)
    <br><br>
    The superego may also allow the aforementioned sublimation to occur.
    <br><br>
    Women have a less developed superego than men. This is not the fault of their own but rather society. As Lacan explains women are essentially the dialectic of man, she is made in the image of desire and nothing more. Women are postied as being x because they are not y. They exist because of the realm of man.
    This leads to them having a different development of the super-ego. Women do not experience the same stimuli as a man because they are a product of domination. They may not have the same scope of their super ego because they're limited by the normative factor of gender.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Oedipus Complex</text><br>
    The Oedipus complex is the desire for ‘sex’ with the mother which occurs in the phallic stage of development. (While Freud saw no use in the Electra Complex Carl Jung proposed the son has this attachment to the mother and the daughter to the father). The desire is not as plain as sex as we colloquially refer to it rather
    it is a lust for attachment to the mother. Examples are to; become one with the mother physically or to physically possess her (so it is in a way the ‘god complex of the child’). This is due to the breast being an extension of the child in the child's mind, as seen in the oral stage. The mother however cannot always provide
    sex to the child thus competition between the child and the mother is born. This leads to the castration complex. The castration anxiety is the fear that is bread within the castration complex of losing the phallus. The child then must internalize its emotions for fear of castration. Thus the father is a symbol of authority.
    The father is an internalized father and is built within this. Freud believed that there must always be issues within the Oedipus complex, thus psycho-analysis is born. Psycho-analysis then is an exploration of the issues within the Oedipus complex and how these manifest within our everyday lives.
    <br><br>
    There are many issues that arise as a result of Oedipus. Below I have listed a few.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">The Guilty Super Ego</text><br>
    The superego is born within the primal family, and thus a product of the Oedipus complex which is mentioned above. The superego is a pulling force of the parent. Therefore it feels guilt from that primal family. The first sense of guilt was from this (please don't read this literally) lust for the mother. The child desired to kill the
    father. In the successful act, he carried with him a god, in the form of the super-ego. The father carries the guilt within the murderous child. This emotion is carried on and is found in that emotion. This is why guilt can be found even in inaction. It is the all-knowing father that keeps us in check. This to the keen eye is very similar
    to Foucault's idea of the punishment system. Rightfully so the guards may be a symbol for the father. Even if he may not be there literally he exists within the inmates. The unknowingness of the guard's judgment is what keeps us in line. The same as civilization is kept in line by the all-knowing super-ego
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “Disciplinary power, on the other hand, is exercised through its invisibility; at the same time it imposes on those whom it subjects a principle of compulsory visibility. In discipline, it is the subjects who have to be seen. Their visibility assures the hold of the power that is exercised over them. It is this fact of being constantly
      seen, of being able always to be seen, that maintains the disciplined individual in his subjection. And the examination is the technique by which power, instead of emitting the signs of its potency, instead of imposing its mark on its subjects, holds them in a mechanism of objectification. In this space of domination, disciplinary power
      manifests its potency, essentially by arranging objects. The examination is, as it were, the ceremony of this objectification.”
    </i>
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Madonna Whore Complex</text><br>
    The madonna whore complex or MWC for short arises as a result of the fear of fatherly castration. The child is fearful of their father's will to castrate him. He feels as though he cant experience love in a sexual manner because of this. Just as he loses his lust for his mother because of his father the super-ego maintains this relationship.
    He feels as though the act of sex has become abstract from love because of this. Sex is merely an act of the pleasure ego and feels no meaning other than instinct.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Phallic Stage</text><br>
    Around age 3–6 the child is now dealing with the Oedipus complex. The child has to recognize and resolve the Oedipus complex (and Electra complex for the neo-Freudians). Fixation within this stage will cause sexual dysfunction in the child's later life.
    <br><br>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Latent and Genital Stage
  </h3>
  <p>
    <text class="h4">Latent</text><br>
    Within the latent stage, the child refocuses its libidinal energy into something such as intellectual skills or social skills. The child will become more social and develop their peer relations. Play becomes more largely defined by same-sex gender interaction.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Latent</text><br>
    The genital stage occurs from ages twelve and on. This is a period of reaching sexual maturity. This stage adds a sexual interest and a movement away from purely focusing one desire on the individual self.
    <br><br>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Freud and Civilization
  </h3>
  <p>
    Freud believed similarly to Hobbes that humans were animals in a way by nature. That they were chiefly driven by desire and not tame by nature. They must then be civilized by society and the taboo within it. As aforementioned this may be applied to the day-to-day life of the individual. We do not act in certain ways because they are stigmatized
    within society. Take for example a class setting, we do not blurt out an answer or thought unless prompted. This is due to the taboo associated with the setting. This in a broader sense, with more taboos is how our society operates according to Freud.
    <br><br>
    This starts with the primal horde theory. The basic thought behind this theory is that civilization and the rules surrounding it are based on a primal family. The family is the first sexual relationship and community. The father wishes to stay with his love object, the
    mother, and the mother wishes to stay with the children. As the children develop their lust for their mother grows. As understood within the Oedipus section. Within this relationship, the children grow to realize they can work together and overthrow the father. While
    this may seem juvenile it is less literal than face value. Take for example fish. The idea of the father may be seen as the shark or other predator. In an attempt to defend themselves against this danger that is a set authority, the predator, and the animals operate together.
    In this, they manage to operate as a more powerful singular being. Through Civilization!
    <br><br>
    There is also love within civilization. Love is the way basis of civilization. It stems from the aforementioned family model. The father feels love towards the mother and the mother reciprocates this emotion. The father may feel love towards anything he sees himself within.
    Take for example a community. The father may like to fish, and thus finds himself loving his friends within the fishing community. In this way, his love object is a reflection of things he himself loves. This is why it commonly reflects the mother. The same may extend to women.

    <text class="h4">Interpretation of Dreams, within Freud</text><br>
    The Dream has a surface-level meaning and a latent meaning according to Freud. Take for example a dream of you kicking some random person in your dreams. The surface-level understanding of this dream would just be the basic story. The latent would be that maybe you have some frustration with your parent that is expressed through this violence within
    your dream. This process is known as displacement. This can be seen through the quote below
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “Dream-displacement and dream-condensation are the two foremen in charge of the dream-work, and we may put the shaping of our dreams down mainly to their activity.”
    </i>
    During Dreams, repressions may relax. This leads to the aforementioned manifestations. The raw material that may slip into these dreams can also be attributed to day’s residues. The day's residues are leftover memory traces from when the individual was awake. Freud also mentions wish fulfillment within the dream. Take for example a child that needs to pee, they may wet their bed without realizing they are asleep. This is due to the child's need to pee therefore satisfying their Id's need within the dream, imaging a toilet as well.
    <br><br>
    Freud begins the interpretation of dreams by discussing hypermnesic dreams. To explain what I hypermnesic dream is I will provide my own hypothetical, so I don't keep repeating Freud's anecdotes. Say you are walking along the beach and you see the word “Rocky Road.” Without pondering you recognize that this is a type of ice cream and not the same as the literal phrase rocky road. In this example assume you don't realize how you knew it was a type of ice cream, you have no memory of the phrase or the item. How did you recognize it
    if it is seemingly brand new to you? This may be because the word has not been directly recognized by you but you have seen it. In Freud's anecdotes, he gives one of Delboef, a man, who had a dream of a fern and immediately recognized its Latin name within the dream. Even though he had no recognition of the term, it seemingly popped out of nowhere. Unannounced to him 2 years prior he wrote down the Latin names of a few ferns. So he was able to access this unconscious memory within his dream because dreams can recognize more than the
    waking person and are a form of access to the Ucs.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">The Purpose of Human Life According To Their Behavior...</text><br>
    Freud speaks of human natural behavior numerous times. This is understood through the civilization writings previously mentioned and also through their purposes. Humans strive to achieve happiness and remain in this state. The purpose of human life is the program of the pleasure principle. The Pleasure Principle Afterall “Dominates the mental apparatus.” (Civilization and Its Discontents, 25). However, satisfaction is most highly met in sudden satisfaction of needs as opposed to prolonged ones. Thus we only get enjoyment because of contrast.
    As Freud Summarizes below.
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “We are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from a state of things. Thus our possibilities of happiness are already restricted by our constitution. Unhappiness is much less difficult to experience.”
    </i>
    <br><br>
    According to Freud, we have 3 sources of suffering within this world. The sources are; “the superior power of nature, and the feebleness which adjusts the mutual relationships of human beings in the family, the state, and society”(Civilization and its discontents, 37). We are forced to see these as inevitable and unconquerable. This does not however paralyze us, because it warrants the removal of some suffering. [1, Freudo-Marxism]. However, controlling nature does not warrant absolute happiness. Take for instance the modern-day, we may be happier
    than someone 100 years ago with our technological advancements however we are not happier to the substantial degree that you may assume. Freud explains this by stating that power over nature may be a precondition for happiness and not the overall means of achieving it.
    <br><br>
    If the aforementioned needs aren't met they may be expressed in other ways (Developing on the aforementioned, Wish Fulfillment). The needs of someone may be expressed through neurosis. This is done through substituted satisfactions, which occur when someone may be young. Therefore it comes from a failure to achieve those satisfactions. Freud dislikes religion for this very reason, it opposes some equality or normativity in something that is subjective and not equal. It is a protection from suffering- which I elaborate on in the next paragraph- and
    is then neurosis.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Then What Is Nature?</text><br>
    Well to start off this explanation of nature I must first explain what nature consists of. We must examine nature before simply defining it as Freud understands it.
    <br><br>
    So Let's begin by defining civilization because this plays into nature. Civilization is the sum of all man's achievements and regulations. (Civilization and Its Discontents,
    42). This serves the purpose of protecting man both within mutual relations and relations between nature. We enact these through linguistics which guides ourselves, which Freud refers to as linguistic feelings. These allow us to meet the desires of our inner judgment without concrete expression, allowing for an abstract or ambiguous meaning.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Act 1</text><br>
    Within the first acts of civilization, we have basic control of nature. This would include things such as control of fire, basic tools, and some level of basic habitation. Fire is the greatest achievement of this act, which sets the stage for the further development of civilization. He uses these to further his conquest of nature, and further abridge what it means to be a human. This can be understood in the quote below (Civilization and its Discontents, 43).
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “Within every tool, man is perfecting his own organs, whether motor or sensory, or is removing the limits to their functioning. Motor power places gigantic forces at his disposal, which, like his muscles, he can employ in any direction; thanks to ships and aircraft neither water nor air can hinder his movements […]”
    </i>
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Freud and Religion</text><br>
    Freud believes that the pleasure principle is what created religion. That it is an expression of the desire for love and desire for the father's admiration. He wishes to enforce the reality principle and dispel religion because it ignores the aforementioned reality principle. I don't think Freud is necessarily hating on religion because he ‘hates it’ rather he just wishes to understand the truth and prefers the reality principle to the pleasure principle.
    <br><br>
    Freud believes that the reality principle is that which civilizes us as humans. Thus a deflection of it is infantile. In the aforementioned paragraphs, I have described how humans seek pleasure above all else, Freud sees religion as a way of coping with the harsh reality of the world and its influences. Freud summarizes this in the quote below (Civilization and Its Discontents, 26)
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “It is no wonder if, under the pressure of these possiblities[…] man thinks himself happy merely to have escaped unhappiness or to have survived his suffering, and if in general the task of avoiding suffering pushes that of obtaining pleasure into the background.”
    </i>
    <br><br>
    This may be applied to a broader spectrum as well, however, religion seems to be somewhat of an exception in its ability to make us forget about our misery. Art for example allows us to induce some feeling of mild narcosis. Even if the story behind the painting may induce neurosis it is not as strong as the complete shift in conception induced by religion. An example of a common simulation of this common sentiment would be art. As seen in the quote below. (Civilization and its discontents, 31)
    <br><br>
    <i>
      “Nevertheless, the mild narcosis induced in us by art can do more than bring about a transient withdrawal from the pressure of the vital needs, and it is not strong enough to make us forget real misery.”
    </i>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Freudo-Marxism
  </h3>
  <p>
    Everyone in a Freudian sense is in some respect a paranoic. This comes with the harsh reality of the modern-day. A Freudo-Marxist would see such as thing and say that capitalism is taking advantage of the operations of the psych and using it to the bourgeois advantage. Within the economics of the libido; we prefer quick gratification to a longer more dedicated effort. This plays well into the exploitation of this within capitalism. Similar to Marcuse's explanation; life is separated into
    two systems work and pleasure (at home time). Capitalism relies on this separation to exploit the economics of the libido. As previously mentioned we desire happiness, however, it is preferable to mix this with unhappiness rather than achieving a resting state of satisfaction. This may be another reason for capitalist realism (see Words You May Need To Know) prevalence within modern neo-liberalism. Capital works to exploit the economics of the libido just enough to have your satisfaction granted, to a degree of minimal need.
    <br><br>
    As mentioned in [1] we are not paralyzed by our inability to achieve complete satisfaction because it allows us to achieve some. In the same way, capitalism exploits this, at least our modern iteration of monopoly capitalism. This goes as the following; the malleability of capitalism allows our desire to transform and minimize that suffering, yet plays on our innate knowledge that some suffering is inevitable and repurposes that into a state of complacency.
    <br><br>
    Freud and feminism pair very well, even if it may seem a contradiction. The most controversial point about Freud is his understanding of the superego and women, which I have mentioned previously. As aforementioned the superego is a product of parental development. I don't think Freud would nessicarily agree with this argument however I think It may be appropriate to reformulate his view to meet such.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Freud and Feminism
  </h3>
  <p>
    A broader understanding of “Penis Envy”, the emotion that women and men both face may be attributed to the construct of the patriarchy. In the modern day, we may take Marcuse's understanding of women as an example. For Marcuse, women are living proof of some sort of class divide. Women and men are separated by their roles within society and gender roles. To act against these is to go against the taboo. To return to penis envy, Freud expresses this as a lust for the female to have a penis, which is realized
    following Oedipus and castration. The women attribute this envy to the thought they have been castrated by their father and that is why they no longer have a penis. To apply this more broadly we must analyze the structures within society. Take for example, prior to the 19th amendment, women wished to vote. The envy of the penis may be attributed to a “right” that the male may have that they don't. The resolution is the women feel jealous of that right, or penis. Feeling the lack of the phallus, voting right, they may also attribute
    this to a sort of melancholy that is analogous to Freud's example of castration.

  <h3>
    The Problem of Anxiety
  </h3>
  <p>
    The problem of anxiety is a more ‘niche’ book by Freud. I am going to briefly discuss the topics below in this section because it is such a dense book. I would not be surprised if this ends up being one of the longer text sections.
    <br><br>
    Freud defines two terms to begin, which shall be referenced throughout this entire next section. Starting with inhibition; inhibition is the restriction of a function, which does not necessitate pathology. It is a ‘normal’ reduction of a function. The next term is a symptom. A symptom is an indicator of a morbid process. It may also be a symptom. Freud explains the relationship between the two by speech. Speech causes us to speak of inhibition only when a reduction is present. So in this way inhibition and function are bound to one another.
    Freud states that this necessitates his investigation of the function of the ego and how it manifests through neurotic affection.
    <br><br>
    Inhibition is described through a few major points in men- The turning aside of the libido [psychic unpleasure], the absence of physical preparedness [non-erectibility], and the abbreviation of the act [ejaculatio praecox]. To put these in simpler terms the turning aside of the libido is unpleasurable sensations within sex or the inability to orgasm. Nonerectibility is the inability of a male to have an erection, and ejaculatio praecox is premature ejaculation. Freud however saw these as positive because they suspended the orgasm.
    Freud referred to this as cumulation.
    <br><br>
    <text class="h4">Relationships and Anxiety</text><br>
    Relationships were cause for anxiety. Within sexual function, Freud stated that women dread it. He categorized this dread of sexual function as hysteria. Compulsive acts are another product of our sexual experience which is a product of precaution and assurance against sexual experience. They are therefore phobic.
    <br><br>
    Therefore the turning aside of the libido produced inhibition, which impairs the execution of the function. This renders it difficult through pure inhibition which prevents through cautionary measures. This is the discontinuance of the development of anxiety. This is a reaction or protest against the act and a desire to undo its cause. An example of this would be, as Freud gives, anorexia. Anorexia is caused by a withdrawal in the libido. Vomiting is a defense against the compulsion to eat. Therefore a refusal to eat is a product of anxiety.
